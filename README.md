Our project is PinksiClub. It's a club for people who play tabel tennis or ping-pong and want to practice with other players. 
We would like to make a web page where are listed places where can be played, who is available, what time trainer can be in place and what time are tournaments. 
Also we would like to make a booking and canceling option for rooms or tables. 
Booking could be like 1-2 person can do it, so if one cancels then whoever wants to practice with someone can book. 
Also there should be chat option, so people could communicate with one another. 
And if we have time and ability we would like to make an app for it, but it's when we have time.
